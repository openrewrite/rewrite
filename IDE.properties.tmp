# If you are only working on a subset of the modules in this project, you can optimize your
# IDE to only load those modules. Copy `IDE.properties.tmp` to `IDE.properties` and comment out
# any lines that correspond to modules you do not want to work on. This will cause Gradle to
# swap those project dependencies for binary dependencies resolved from either Maven local or
# the OSS snapshots repository, and speed up your IDE.

# To work on Java recipes, you generally only need rewrite-java and rewrite-java-test.
# The former is where the recipe logic lives, and the latter is where the tests live.
# rewrite-java-tck and rewrite-java-17 are only needed if you intend to work on the
# language parser.

# Other language modules

rewrite-gradle
rewrite-groovy
rewrite-hcl
rewrite-json
rewrite-maven
rewrite-properties
rewrite-protobuf
rewrite-xml
rewrite-yaml

# These aren't depended on by any other modules, so if you comment them out
# there is no need for a binary dependency substitution rule.
