# Scala Language Support Implementation Plan

This document tracks the implementation plan for adding Scala language support to OpenRewrite.

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps needed to implement a Scala parser and AST model that integrates with OpenRewrite's Lossless Semantic Tree (LST) framework.

### Architecture Approach

As a JVM-based language, Scala's LST implementation will:
- Define an `S` interface that extends from `J` (Java's LST interface)
- Reuse common JVM constructs from the J model (classes, methods, fields, etc.)
- Add Scala-specific constructs to the S interface (pattern matching, traits, implicits, etc.)
- Follow the established pattern used by Groovy (`G extends J`) and Kotlin (`K extends J`)

### Composition Pattern

When implementing Scala-specific LST elements, we will use composition of J elements rather than duplication. This ensures that Java-focused recipes can still operate on Scala code by accessing the composed J elements. For example:

- A Scala pattern match might compose a `J.Switch` internally
- Scala's `for` comprehension could compose `J.ForEachLoop` elements
- Implicit parameters might compose `J.VariableDeclarations`

This composition approach maximizes recipe reusability across all JVM languages.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Parser Implementation (First Priority)
- [x] Create `ScalaParser` class implementing `Parser` interface.
- [x] Integrate with Scala 3 compiler (dotty.tools.dotc)
- [x] Implement builder pattern with classpath/dependency management
- [x] Set up compiler configuration and error handling

The parser is the entry point and must be implemented first, following patterns from `GroovyParser` and `KotlinParser`.

### Phase 2: Parser Visitor Implementation (Second Priority)
- [x] Create `ScalaParserVisitor` implementing Scala compiler's AST visitor
- [x] Map Scala compiler AST elements to S/J LST model
- [ ] Handle all Scala language constructs (in progress)
- [x] Preserve formatting, comments, and type information
- [ ] Implement visitor methods for each Scala AST node type (in progress)

The Parser Visitor bridges the Scala compiler's internal AST with OpenRewrite's LST model.

### Phase 3: Visitor Infrastructure Skeleton
- [x] Create `ScalaVisitor` extending `JavaVisitor`
  - [x] Override `isAcceptable()` and `getLanguage()`
  - [x] Add skeleton visit methods for future S elements
- [x] Create `ScalaIsoVisitor` extending `JavaIsoVisitor`
  - [x] Override methods to provide type-safe transformations
- [x] Create `ScalaPrinter` extending `ScalaVisitor`
  - [x] Implement LST to source code conversion
  - [x] Create inner `ScalaJavaPrinter` for J elements
- [ ] Create supporting classes: `SSpace`, `SLeftPadded`, `SRightPadded`, `SContainer`
  - [ ] Define Location enums for Scala-specific formatting

This infrastructure must be in place before implementing LST elements.

### Phase 4: Testing Infrastructure
- [x] Create `Assertions.java` class with `scala()` methods
- [x] Implement parse-only overload for round-trip testing
- [x] Implement before/after overload for transformation testing
- [x] Configure ScalaParser with appropriate classpath
- [x] Create `org.openrewrite.scala.tree` test package

The Assertions class is the foundation for all Scala LST testing. Each LST element gets a test in `org.openrewrite.scala.tree` that uses `rewriteRun()` with `scala()` assertions to verify parse → print → parse idempotency.

### Phase 5: Core LST Infrastructure
- [x] Create `rewrite-scala` module structure
- [x] Define `S` interface extending `J`
- [x] Implement Scala-specific AST classes in S
- [x] Design composition strategy for Scala constructs using J elements
- [ ] Write unit tests for each LST element in tree package (in progress)

### Phase 6: Advanced Language Features
- [ ] Add type attribution support from compiler
- [ ] Handle Scala-specific features (implicits, traits, pattern matching, etc.)
- [ ] Implement formatting preservation for Scala syntax
- [ ] Support Scala 2 vs Scala 3 differences

### Phase 7: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite beyond tree tests
- [ ] Implement Scala TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit)
- [ ] Validate LST round-trip accuracy
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

### Phase 8: Recipe Support
- [ ] Implement common Scala refactoring recipes
- [ ] Create Scala-specific visitor utilities
- [ ] Document recipe development patterns

## Technical Considerations

### Key Scala Features to Support
- Pattern matching
- Implicit conversions and parameters
- Traits and mixins
- Case classes and objects
- Higher-kinded types
- Macros (Scala 2 vs Scala 3)
- Extension methods
- Union and intersection types (Scala 3)

### Integration Points
- Compatibility with existing Java recipes where applicable
- Interoperability with mixed Java/Scala codebases
- Build tool integration (SBT, Maven, Gradle)

## LST Element Mapping Plan

When implementing the Scala LST model, we'll map elements progressively from simple to complex. This approach allows us to build a solid foundation and test each element thoroughly before moving to more complex constructs.

### Testing Strategy
Each LST element will have comprehensive tests in `org.openrewrite.scala.tree`:
- Parse-only tests to verify round-trip accuracy
- Tests for all syntax variations
- Tests for formatting preservation
- Tests for type attribution (when available)

### Implementation Notes
- Start with Phase 1 and complete all testing before moving to Phase 2
- Each element should preserve all original formatting and comments
- Use composition of J elements wherever possible for recipe compatibility
- Document any Scala-specific formatting in Location enums
- Consider Scala 2 vs Scala 3 syntax differences in each element

## Implementation Progress

### Current Status (As of Jul 11, 2025)

We have successfully completed the foundational infrastructure and are making good progress on LST element implementation. Currently at **100% test passing rate (127/127 tests)**.

#### Completed LST Elements ✅

    - Multiple arguments: `Math.max(10, 20)`
    - Chained calls: `"hello".toUpperCase().substring(1)`
    - Field access calls: `System.out.println("test")`
    - Named arguments, infix calls, apply methods, curried calls all supported
12. **Control Flow** (7/7 tests passing) - Basic control flow constructs
    - If statements: `if (cond) expr`
    - If-else statements: `if (cond) expr1 else expr2`
    - Nested if statements and if-else-if chains
    - While loops: `while (cond) { body }`
    - Blocks: `{ statement1; statement2 }`
    - For comprehensions preserved as Unknown (complex Scala-specific syntax)

#### Not Started Yet ❌
1. Classes, traits, objects, pattern matching, etc.

### Key Technical Decisions Made
- Using Unknown nodes to preserve formatting for unimplemented constructs
- Wrapping bare expressions in object wrappers for valid Scala syntax
- Updated assignment tests to use object blocks since Scala doesn't allow top-level assignments
- Implemented multi-line detection in isSimpleExpression to avoid inappropriate wrapping
- Fixed expression duplication by excluding postfix operators from wrapping and handling unary operators in Select nodes
- Fixed comment handling by updating Space.format to properly extract comments from whitespace
- Fixed infixWithDot issue by preserving parentheses as Unknown nodes
- Fixed package duplication by properly updating cursor position after package declaration
- Decided to keep imports as Unknown nodes for now after encountering double printing issues with J.Import

### Incremental Implementation Lessons Learned
When attempting to implement import mapping to J.Import, we encountered issues with imports being processed twice (once as J.Import and once as J.Unknown), resulting in double printing. Investigation revealed:

1. **Multiple visitor calls**: The Scala compiler's AST structure for imports causes the visitor to be called multiple times for the same import statement
2. **Incomplete field access**: When parsing `import scala.collection.mutable`, only `scala.collection` was being captured in the J.Import
3. **Cursor management complexity**: Managing the cursor position to prevent duplicate source consumption proved challenging
4. **Debug findings**:
   - Import expression was a Select node with name "collection" and qualifier "scala"
   - The full path "mutable" was not being captured in the field access construction
   - Both J.Import and J.Unknown were being added, causing double printing

This reinforced the importance of:
1. Understanding the compiler's AST structure thoroughly before implementation
2. Starting with simple cases that clearly map to existing LST elements
3. Using J.Unknown for complex cases to preserve formatting while keeping tests passing
4. Adding support gradually as patterns emerge and issues are understood
5. Not trying to handle all variations at once

**Future approach**: Now that Select nodes map to J.FieldAccess, we need to:
1. Resolve the cursor management issues preventing proper source consumption
2. Fix the multiple visitor calls for the same import statement
3. Ensure the J.Import properly captures the complete field access without duplication

### Next Steps
1. Implement classes, traits, and objects
2. Add pattern matching support
3. Circle back to imports once we better understand the cursor management patterns
4. Eventually create S.Import for Scala-specific import syntax (multi-select, aliases)
5. Create S.ForComprehension for Scala's complex for loops with generators and guards

## Notes

This plan will evolve as we progress through the implementation.
