maven,org.openrewrite:rewrite-core,org.openrewrite.Singleton,Singleton,"Used as a precondition to ensure that a recipe attempts to make changes only once. Accidentally including multiple copies/instances of the same large composite recipes is a common mistake. If those recipes are marked with this precondition the performance penalty is limited. This recipe does nothing useful run on its own.

## Usage in YAML recipes

Add `org.openrewrite.Singleton` as a precondition:

```yaml
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.example.Append
displayName: My recipe
preconditions:
  - org.openrewrite.Singleton
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.text.AppendToTextFile:
      relativeFileName: report.txt
      content: 'Recipe executed'
```## Usage in Java recipes

Wrap visitors with `Singleton.singleton(this, visitor)` to ensure only the first *equivalent* recipe instance makes changes:

```java
@Override
public TreeVisitor<?, ExecutionContext> getVisitor(Accumulator acc) {
    return singleton(this, new TreeVisitor<Tree, ExecutionContext>() {
        @Override
        public Tree visit(@Nullable Tree tree, ExecutionContext ctx) {
            // Your transformation logic
            return tree;
        }
    });
}
@Override
public Collection<SourceFile> generate(Accumulator acc, ExecutionContext ctx) {
    if (!isSingleton(this, ctx)) {
        return Collections.emptyList();
    }
    // Generate new sources
    return results;
}

@Override
public TreeVisitor<?, ExecutionContext> getVisitor(Accumulator acc) {
    return singleton(this, new TreeVisitor<Tree, ExecutionContext>() {
        // Visitor logic
    });
}
```

**Note:** Singleton status is determined by the recipe's `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods. If equivalent instances of a recipe are not considered singletons, ensure your recipe class correctly implements these methods. The easiest way is to use Lombok's `@Value` annotation on your recipe class, which automatically generates correct `equals()` and `hashCode()` implementations based on all fields.",1,,,
